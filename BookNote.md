#### Count of combination for unique binary numbers:

- Count of combination for n bits is `2 ^ n`
  - b = bit & B = byte
  - Combination for 4b or nibble: max is 1111 so the count will be 2 ^ 4 = 16
  - Combination for 1B or 8b: max is 1111 1111 so the count will be 2 ^ 8 = 256

### SI Prefixes (metric) || IEEE Prefixes (binary)

- `1K (Kilo) = 10 ^ 3` || `1Ki (Kibi) = 2 ^ 10 = 1024`
- `1M (Mega) = 10 ^ 6` || `1Mi (Mebi) = 2 ^ 20`
- `1G (Giga) = 10 ^ 9` || `1Gi (Gibi) = 2 ^ 30`
- `1T (Tera) = 10 ^ 12` || `1Ti (Tebi) = 2 ^ 40`

#### Binary prefixes vs metric prefixes:

- When dealing with `storage capacity`, such as the size of a file or the capacity of a storage device, it's common to use `binary prefixes` , where `megabyte = 2 ^ 20 bytes`.
  This is because computers use binary (base-2) numbering systems, and storage capacities are typically measured in powers of 2.

- When dealing with `Data Transfer Rates`, internet service providers and networking equipment often use `metric prefixes`, where `megabyte per second = 10 ^ 6 bytes per second`. This is based on the standard metric system (base-10) and is commonly used to express data transfer rates over networks.

### Hexadecimal

We use hexadecimal just to help us in convert decimal to binary faster because it is short.

2,320,695,04 in decimal = 1000 1010 0101 0010 1111 1111 0000 0000 in binary = 8A52FF00 in hexadecimal
